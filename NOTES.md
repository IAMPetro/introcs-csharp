C\# Notes for Comp 170
======================

By Drs. Andrew N. Harrington and George K. Thiruvathukal
--------------------------------------------------------

You may use any of the C\# Notes formats:

-   As web pages
    -   [Browse the notes online](CSharpHtml/index.html). Html format
        flows to fit the width of your window.
    -   Download the [zip file to view locally](CSharpHtml.zip): The web
        page to open after expanding the zip file
        is CSharpHtml/index.html.
-   [PDF file](ProgrammingInCSharp.pdf) in fixed paged format for
    printing and for somewhat prettier computer viewing if your screen
    is wide enough.

In any case be sure to download the simple [examples zip
file](examples.zip) and the [monodevelop projects zip
file](projects.zip) then expand each to have all the C\# example
programs and projects that go with the notes.

To quickly browse and download individual files in the examples and
projects folders, go to:
